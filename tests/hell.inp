* B VII II VIII HELL
HELL

CANTO I Dante astray in a wood reaches the foot of a hill
which he begins to ascend he is hindered by three beasts he
turns back and is met by Virgil who proposes to guide him into
the eternal world

Midway upon the road of our life I found myself within a dark
wood for the right way had been missed Ah how hard a thing it
is to tell what this wild and rough and dense wood was which in
thought renews the fear So bitter is it that death is little
more But in order to treat of the good that there I found I
will tell of the other things that I have seen there I cannot
well recount how I entered it so full was I of slumber at that
point where I abandoned the true way But after I had arrived at
the foot of a hill where that valley ended which had pierced my
heart with fear I looked on high and saw its shoulders clothed
already with the rays of the planet that leadeth men aright
along every path Then was the fear a little quieted which in the
lake of my heart had lasted through the night that I passed so
piteously And even as one who with spent breath issued out of
the sea upon the shore turns to the perilous water and gazes so
did my soul which still was flying turn back to look again upon
the pass which never had a living person left
The sun a planet according to the Ptolemaic system

After I had rested a little my weary body I took my way again
along the desert slope so that the firm foot was always the
lower And ho almost at the beginning of the steep a
sheleopard light and very nimble which was covered with a
spotted coat And she did not move from before my face nay
rather hindered so my road that to return I oftentimes had
turned

The time was at the beginning of the morning and the Sun was
mounting upward with those stars that were with him when Love
Divine first set in motion those beautiful things so that the
hour of the time and the sweet season were occasion of good hope
to me concerning that wild beast with the dappled skin But not
so that the sight which appeared to me of a lion did not give me
fear He seemed to be coming against me with head high and with
ravening hunger so that it seemed that the air was affrighted at
him And a shewolf who with all cravings seemed laden in her
meagreness and already had made many folk to live forlornshe
caused me so much heaviness with the fear that came from sight
of her that I lost hope of the height And such as he is who
gaineth willingly and the time arrives that makes him lose who
in all his thoughts weeps and is sad such made me the beast
without repose that coming on against me little by little was
pushing me back thither where the Sun is silent
According to old tradition the spring was the season of the
creation
These three beasts correspond to the triple division of sins
into those of incontinence of violence and of fraud

While I was falling back to the low place before mine eyes
appeared one who through long silence seemed hoarse When I saw
him in the great desert Have pity on me I cried to him
whatso thou art or shade or real man He answered me Not
man man once I was and my parents were Lombards and Mantuans
by country both I was born sub Julio though late and I lived
at Rome under the good Augustus in the time of the false and
lying gods Poet was I and sang of that just son of Anchises who
came from Troy after proud Ilion had been burned But thou why
returnest thou to so great annoy Why dost thou not ascend the
delectable mountain which is the source and cause of every joy
Art thou then that Virgil and that fount which poureth forth so
large a stream of speech replied I to him with bashful front
O honor and light of the other poem I may the long seal avail
me and the great love which have made me search thy volume
Thou art my master and my author thou alone art he from whom I
took the fair style that hath done me honor Behold the beast
because of which I turned help me against her famous sage for
she makes any veins and pulses tremble Thee it behoves to hold
another course he replied when he saw me weeping if thou
wishest to escape from this savage place for this beast because
of which thou criest out lets not any one pass along her way
but so hinders him that she kills him and she has a nature so
malign and evil that she never sates her greedy will and after
food is hungrier than before Many are the animals with which she
wives and there shall be more yet till the hound  shall come
that will make her die of grief He shall not feed on land or
goods but wisdom and love and valor and his birthplace shall be
between Feltro and Feltro Of that humble Italy shall he be the
salvation for which the virgin Camilla died and Euryalus Turnus
and Nisus of their wounds He shall hunt her through every town
till he shall have set her back in hell there whence envy first
sent her forth Wherefore I think and deem it for thy best that
thou follow me and I will be thy guide and will lead thee hence
through the eternal place where thou shalt hear the despairing
shrieks shalt see the ancient spirits woeful who each proclaim
the second death And then thou shalt see those who are contented
in the fire because they hope to come whenever it may be to the
blessed folk to whom if thou wilt thereafter ascend them shall be
a soul more worthy than I for that With her I will leave thee at
my departure for that Emperor who reigneth them above because I
was rebellious to His law wills not that into His city any one
should come through me In all parts He governs and them He reigns
there in His city and His lofty seat O happy he whom thereto He
elects And I to him Poet I beseech thee by that God whom thou
didst not know in order that I may escape this ill and worse that
thou lead me thither whom thou now hest said so that I may see the
gate of St Peter and those whom thou makest so afflicted
Of whom the hound is the symbol and to whom Dante looked for
the deliverance of Italy from the discorda and misrule that made
her wretched is still matter of doubt after centuries of
controversy Fallen humiliated

Then he moved on and I behind him kept
